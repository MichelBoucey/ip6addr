	- Version 0.3.3 released.
	- ip6addrgen now deals with leading zeros in 16bits
          token.

	- Version 0.3.2 released.
	- Fixed a mis pattern matching in version 0.3.1.
	- Better pattern matching ISATAP adresses to keep
	  their IPv4 dotted representation in IPv6 addresses.

	- Version 0.3.1 released.
	- The command-line tool 'ip6addrcan' now rewrites the
          embedded IPv4 adress in hexadecimal digits to output
          pure IPv6 text representation. But some IPv6 adresses
          with well-known prefixes (IPv4-compatible, IPv4-mapped,
          IPv4-translated, IPv4-translatable, ISATAP) keeps
          visible the embedded IPv4 dotted representation to keep
          visible in the text representation the fact they deals
          with IPv4 to IPv6 transition process.

	- Version 0.3 released.
	- The command-line tool 'ip6addrval' is renamed (for the
	  last time) 'ip6addrcan'. This tool now outputs rewrited
	  valid IPv6 addresses canonized in conformation with
	  RFC 5952, which updates RFC 4291.
	- 'ip6addrgen' is not updated yet from RFC 4291 to RFC 5952.
	  Outputted adresses from 'ip6addrgen' have to be pipelined
	  through 'ip6addrcan'.

	- Version 0.2 released.
	- The command-line tool 'ip6addr' is renamed 'ip6addrval'.
	  This tool now validates CIDR suffix if exists and
          outputs IPv6 adresses with CIDR prefixes cutted off.
	- The command-line tool 'ip6addrgen' is added.
          This tool generates random IPv6 adresses.
          Two options : -n to provide a count of IPv6 adresses
	  to output, -p to provide an uncompressed prefix to apply
	  to each outputted address.

	- Version 0.1.1 released.
	- Fixed three bugs in IPv6 address validation.
	- Added a test written in Perl.
