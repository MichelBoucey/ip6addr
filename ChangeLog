	- Version 0.3 released.
	- The command-line tool 'ip6addrval' is renamed (for the
	  last time) 'ip6addrcan'. This tool now outputs rewrited
	  valid IPv6 addresses canonized in conformation with
	  RFC 5952, which updates RFC 4291.
	- ip6addrgen is not updated yet from RFC 4291 to RFC 5952.
	  Outputted adresses from ip6addrgen have to be pipelined
	  through ip6addrcan.

	- Version 0.2 released.
	- The command-line tool 'ip6addr' is renamed 'ip6addrval'.
	  This tool now validates CIDR suffix if exists and
          outputs IPv6 adresses with CIDR prefixes cutted off.
	- The command-line tool 'ip6addrgen' is added.
          This tool generates random IPv6 adresses.
          Two options : -n to provide a count of IPv6 adresses
	  to output, -p to provide an uncompressed prefix to apply
	  to each outputted address.
