	- Version 0.2 released.
	- The command-line tool 'ip6addr' is renamed ip6addrval.
	  This tool now validates CIDR suffix if exists and
          outputs IPv6 adresses with CIDR prefixes cutted off.
	- The command-line tool 'ip6addrgen' is added.
          This tool generates random IPv6 adresses.
          Two options : -n to provide a count of IPv6 adresses to output,
          -p to provide an uncompressed prefix to apply to each outputted address.
