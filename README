ip6addr provides command-line tools (written in Haskell) to deal with
text representation of IPv6 Addresses :

- 'ip6addrcan' parses and canonizes IPv6 addresses against RFC 4291 and
  RFC 5952. IPv6 adresses already compressed are recomputed. Embedded
  IPv4 adress is rewritten into hexadecimal digits, except for well-
  known IPv6 prefixes.

- 'ip6addrgen' generates random IPv6 addresses.
